Reporting Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When reporting issues, we ask users to please make every effort to collect and provide as much the information identified below as possible.
We understand that thorough issue reporting can be onerous.
At the same time, being as thorough as possible in issue reporting is a key way users can reciprocate for the free and open source software projects they benefit from.
In addition, the more information that is included in an issue report, the more likely the issue can be diagnoseed quickly and a work-around or resolution developed.

For these reasons, we urge users to please provide as much of the following information as practical...

* Operating system name and version (e.g. ``macOS 12.7 Monterey`) 
* Version number of VisIt_
* The specific release asset (e.g. ``visit3_3_3.linux-x86_64-rhel7-wmesa.tar.gz``) installed or if VisIt_ was built from sources, the ``build_visit`` command-line used (often available in the ``build_visit_log`` file where VisIt_ was built).
*
